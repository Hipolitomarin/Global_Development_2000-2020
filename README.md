üìù Description
This comprehensive dataset merges global economic, environmental, technological, and human development indicators from 2000 to 2020. Sourced and transformed from multiple public datasets via Google BigQuery, it is designed for advanced exploratory data analysis, machine learning, policy modeling, and sustainability research.

Curated by combining and transforming data from the Google BigQuery Public Data program, this dataset offers a harmonized view of global development across more than 40 key indicators spanning over two decades (2000‚Äì2020). It supports research across multiple domains such as:

Economic Growth
Climate Sustainability
Digital Transformation
Public Health
Human Development
Resilience and Governance

üéØ Objectives:
- Understand trends over time (e.g., GDP, emissions, life expectancy)
- Compare development patterns across regions/income groups
- Explore relationships among health, environment, and digital growth
- Highlight pandemic period effects and resilience metrics
- Create a machine learning model to predict the GPD depending of other variables.

üìö Libraries Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and handling tabular data structures.
- **numpy**: Provides support for numerical operations on arrays and matrices.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Offers machine learning tools including data splitting, preprocessing, modeling (Random Forest), evaluation metrics, and feature importance analysis.
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: Used for creating visualizations and plots.
- **seaborn**: Provides enhanced statistical plotting capabilities built on top of matplotlib.

üìÖ Temporal Coverage
Years: 2000‚Äì2020

Includes calculated features:

years_since_2000
years_since_century
is_pandemic_period (binary indicator for pandemic periods)
